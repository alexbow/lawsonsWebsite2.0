        <h2>“The sound and music are 50% of the entertainment in a movie” -
           George Lucas</h2>
           <br>
        <p>
          I would argue that both sound and music is a few more percentage
          points higher than what the prolific George Lucas said, but I
          have enough self-awareness to know that I’m a little biased.
          And until we are able to incorporate one of the other 5 senses
          (excluding vision) into the large-scale multimedia experience,
          we must rely on both to deliver and celebrate human expressionism.
          And while I may not have the keenest eyes for the visual aspect,
          I have extensive experience using the tools and practices of
          producing and designing sounds for all multimedia productions
          overall.
