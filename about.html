        <div><p>I am an audio engineer and sound designer. I have worked in various
          realms of the audio industry. Some examples are recording and mixing
          music, providing sound design for podcasts, short films, and audio
          dramas, on-set field sound production, etc. I handle each project I
          am tasked with, whether it is to create something new or to help
          support and promote established media. I promise to see each task
          done with punctual proficiency. If you have not already, please feel
          free to explore my little corner of the internet and see -- excuse me
          -- hear what I mean. I am quite versatile and can work between
          operating a mixing console, working with digital audio workstations
          and recording the dialogue for film. So please, let my services be a
          dependable commodity for you. Thank you all for checking out and
          considering what I love to do.</p></div>


          <div><p>
            I love my ears, and, more importantly, using my ears to create,
            recreate, and manipulate sounds for others to perceive. Did you
            know that out of the five senses, we are most sensitive to our sense
            of hearing? It takes between eight and ten milliseconds for us to
            receive and respond to sound. Pretty neat right? In fact, sound is
            able to cross over into other senses, such as a sense of touch.
            Lower-frequencies have a tendency to be experienced less as a sound,
            and more as a feeling. That’s the reason why people often use the
            expression, “I’m feeling it,” whenever someone is laying on some
            funky bass grooves. Anyway, I could go on-and-on about why I love
            this stuff; however, that would completely defeat the purpose of
            this website!</p>
