        <h1>Podcast Production</h1>
        <p>With the rapid spread of smartphone speakers, bluetooth speakers,
          & personalized nature of the content someone consumes, Podcasting
          has begun to take the realm of multimedia by storm. Theyâ€™ve taken
          the convenience of recorded material and merged that with the
          community driven and engaging aspects of radio. But the real
          potential that these auditory stories tell is the versatility of
          formats that creators are continuing to discover. From fictional
          dramas to the building and curating a sonic brand for your
          business, I pledge to not only provide the means to produce a
          podcast but to offer creative consultation towards your production.   </p>
